NAME
    String::Similarity - calculate the similarity of two strings

SYNOPSIS
     use String::Similarity;

     $similarity = similarity $string1, $string2;

DESCRIPTION
    $factor = similarity $string1, $string2
        The `similarity'-function calulcates the similarity index of its two
        arguments. A value of `0' means that the strings are entirely
        different. A value of `1' means the strings are identical.
        Everything else lies describes the amount of similarity between the
        strings.

        It roughly works by looking at the smallest number of edits to
        change one string into the other.

     The basic algorithm is described in:

     Algorithmica Vol. 1 No. 2, 1986, pp. 251-266;
     see especially section 4.2, which describes the variation used below.

     The basic algorithm was independently discovered as described in:
     "Algorithms for Approximate String Matching", E. Ukkonen,
